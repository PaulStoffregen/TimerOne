Paul Stoffregen forked this version from an early copy of TimerOne/TimerThree
which was licensed "Creative Commons Attribution 3.0" and has maintained

Other, separately developed updates to TimerOne have been released by other

the same name but distributed under different license terms, is unfortunately
confusing.  This copy, with nearly all the code redesigned as inline functions,
is provided under the "CC BY 3.0 US" license terms.
