Paul Stoffregen's modified TimerOne.  This version provides 2 main benefits:

1: Optimized inline functions - much faster for the most common usage
2: Support for more boards

Paul Stoffregen forked this version from an early copy of TimerOne/TimerThree

Other, separately developed updates to TimerOne have been released by other

the same name but distributed under different license terms, is unfortunately
confusing.  This copy, with nearly all the code redesigned as inline functions,
