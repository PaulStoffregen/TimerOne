#TimerOne Library

#delta-G Fork:

This fork adds support for the UNO-R4 boards using the AGT1 timer.  PWM functions are not supported. 


Paul Stoffregen's modified TimerOne.  This version provides 2 main benefits:

1: Optimized inline functions - much faster for the most common usage  
2: Support for more boards (including ATTiny85 except for the PWM functionality)
